# Openpyxl-projects

1.) **Openpyxl Basic Automation**
In this project the situation I came up is, If let's say we have an Excel Sheet with hundreds and thousands of lines of data, and needed to edit them for specific changes. We can automate and use this simple logic to finish the task in just a second instead of manually doing it.
This basic automation shows how promising it could be for me to learn more about Automation not just in spreadsheets, but especially in a real world project.
I have also used BarChart and Reference, this is only for me to see how it works and it works quite well.

I have included the sample spreadsheet to edit, if you want to try it for yourself.
Please carefully read the code as well, I have added per line comments for more clarity.

You will need to install python and openpyxl to run the app.
